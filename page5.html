<h2>Image Maps</h2>
<pre>
    With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.
    The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. 
        The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.
        The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on 
        where in the image you click.

To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.
</pre>
<p>Click on the computer, the phone, or the cup of coffee to go to a new page and read more about the topic:</p>

<img src="images/workplace.jpeg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="images/mac.jpeg">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="images/cellphone.jpeg">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of coffee" href="images/coffeehouse2.jpeg" onclick="myFunction()">
</map>
<p>Image Map and JavaScript
    A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function.
    
    Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function:</p>
<hr>
<p>The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:</p>
<p>The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.</p>
<p>You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

    rect - defines a rectangular region
    circle - defines a circular region
    poly - defines a polygonal region
    default - defines the entire region
    You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image.</p>



<pre>
Shape="rect"
The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.

So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:
The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:
</pre>

<hr>

<area shape="circle" coords="337, 300, 44" href="images/coffeehouse2.jpeg">
<pre>
    Shape="circle"
To add a circle area, first locate the coordinates of the center of the circle:

337,300

Then specify the radius of the circle:

44 pixels
Now you have enough data to create a clickable circular area:
</pre>
<hr>
<pre>
    The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).

This can be used to create any shape.
